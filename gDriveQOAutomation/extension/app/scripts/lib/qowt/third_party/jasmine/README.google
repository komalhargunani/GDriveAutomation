Description:
  JavaScript BDD style testing framework which supports describe, it should and
  expect style testing.

Local Modifications:

  The Quickoffice project (acquired by Google) currently requires its own copy
  of this library. A future CL is needed to remove duplicate dependencies and
  use those existing in google3/third_party.

  Log exceptions thrown in async functions.

  Allow runs blocks in tests to return promises, and wait for those promises to
  settle.

  Replaced use of Promise.cast with Promise.resolve to validate promise-like
  objects as the cast method has been removed.

  Renamed jasmine-1.2.0.js as jasmine-1.2.0-patched.js
